        Gaza continues to face an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe as the crisis enters its second year. The scale of suffering has reached catastrophic levels, with our people enduring unimaginable hardships daily.

       Gaza's Devastating Human Toll
      </h3>
      <p>
       The human toll has been devastating.
       <strong>
        At least 59,219 Palestinians have reportedly been killed in Gaza and 143,045 have been injured
       </strong>
       between October 7, 2023, and July 23, 2025, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. Among the identified fatalities,
       <em>
        26,655 were children and civilians
       </em>
       , representing entire families wiped out in moments.

      <h3>
       Gaza's Water Scarcity
      </h3>
      <p>
       Access to clean water has become a luxury that most Gazans cannot afford.
       <strong>
        95% of the population are unable to access safe water,
       </strong>
       forcing families to drink contaminated water that threatens their health and lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some displaced people are
       <em>
        surviving on just 3% of minimum daily water needs
       </em>
       . Children and elderly are particularly vulnerable, with waterborne diseases spreading rapidly through overcrowded shelters.

      <h3>
       Systematic Destruction: Gaza's Hospitals and Healthcare
      </h3>
      <p>
       The healthcare infrastructure has been systematically destroyed. Major hospitals including
       <strong>
        Kamal Adwan Hospital and Indonesia Hospital
       </strong>
       have been severely damaged or rendered non-functional. Healthcare workers struggle to provide even basic medical care without adequate supplies, fuel, or equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The health system is at breaking point
       </em>
       amidst acute shortages of medical supplies, fuel, and shelter. Pregnant women give birth without proper medical care, and children suffer from preventable diseases that could be easily treated under normal circumstances.

    <h3>
     Starvation as a Weapon of War
    </h3>
    <p>
     The deliberate restriction of aid has created conditions of famine.
     <em>
      Since March 2025, Israel has imposed an official blockade
     </em>
     , with Defense Minister declaring that "No humanitarian aid will enter Gaza." The consequences have been devastating:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <strong>
       851 people were killed
      </strong>
      and at least 5,634 injured while trying to access food supplies since May 27, 2025
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Mass casualty events
      </strong>
      have occurred at aid distribution sites, with over 21 separate incidents affecting toddlers, teenagers, elderly, and mothers
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Acute malnutrition
      </strong>
      is spreading rapidly among children and vulnerable populations
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Families go days without food
      </strong>
      , watching their children waste away from hunger
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
     The Fear That Never Leaves
    </h3>
    <p>
     Every day brings new trauma for our people in Gaza. Parents watch helplessly as their children ask for food they cannot provide. Families huddle together, never knowing if they will survive the night. The psychological toll is immeasurable -
     <em>
      an entire population living in constant fear of death
     </em>
     .

    <h2>What if Gaza Talked in Networks?</h2>
    <div class="network-message">
      <pre>
  When it returned <span class="code">200</span> — it was still misunderstood.
  When it sent <span class="code">307</span> — it was redirected, forgotten, misplaced.
  When all it got was <span class="code">400</span> — no one understood the request.
  
  Gaza did everything right.
  It made the request,
  it waited for the response —
  but nothing came back.
  
  Maybe the headers were filtered,
  maybe the payload too heavy with pain,
  or maybe the world’s servers
  just weren't listening.
  
  Our small packets —
  crushed by congestion,
  lost in the noise,
  timed out before they ever reached the gateway.
  
  But still, Gaza speaks networks.
  And it keeps sending the request.

  May Allah relieve their suffering and reward them with the best
