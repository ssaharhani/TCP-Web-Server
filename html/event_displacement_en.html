           According to Human Rights Watch, the Israeli army has ordered around 400,000 people in northern Gaza to leave their homes since October 1st and prevented aid from reaching them, in a forced displacement operation that may amount to a war crime.

           9 out of every 10 people in Gaza have been displaced at least once
          </strong>

          <strong>
           displacement has been repeated 10 times
          </strong>
          for a single family, doubling the suffering of residents and increasing the difficulty of obtaining basic necessities.

          The
          <strong>
           eight historical camps
          </strong>
          in Gaza Strip, dating back to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Nakba, have been subjected to intensive bombardment leading to widespread destruction and forcing their residents to be displaced once again.
         </p>
         <p>
          These camps, which housed
          <strong>
           more than 1.7 million Palestinian refugees
          </strong>
          registered with UNRWA, have transformed from permanent shelters into danger zones, forcing their residents to search for new shelter amid ongoing military operations.

          Humanitarian aid delivery operations face severe challenges, with
          <strong>
           deadly incidents recorded during aerial aid drops
          </strong>
          , while civilian gatherings around aid distribution centers face repeated targeting.

          According to reports,
          <strong>
           more than 1,500 Palestinians were martyred and more than 10,000 others were injured
          </strong>
          by occupation forces' fire while attempting to obtain basic food and medical aid.

          Impact of Displacement on Children and Women

           Women and children constitute the largest proportion of displaced persons
          </strong>
          , facing additional difficulties in accessing healthcare and education. Displaced children suffer from severe psychological trauma as a result of losing their homes and being cut off from education for long periods.
         </p>
         <p>
          International organizations warn that
          <strong>
           an entire generation of Palestinian children
          </strong>
          faces the risk of losing their right to education and normal development, threatening the future of Palestinian society as a whole.
