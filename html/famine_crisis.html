         The spokesperson for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, stated that the famine in Gaza Strip has entered stage five, confirming that health conditions are worsening amid a deliberate starvation policy pursued by the Israeli occupation, and with the absence of effective aid reaching the besieged citizens.

           Al-Daqran pointed out, in an interview with Al Jazeera channel, that the number of malnutrition victims is continuously increasing, noting the registration of 175 deaths due to famine, including 6 cases within just 24 hours, alongside thousands of medical cases that hospitals receive daily.

          He clarified that what the occupation promotes regarding the entry of food and medical aid is
          <strong>
           "completely false"
          </strong>
          , adding that what actually enters are limited quantities that do not meet even a small portion of the population's needs, and are often seized at crossings by lawless groups.
         </p>

          The spokesperson for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital accused the American institution called
          <strong>
           "Gaza Humanitarian"
          </strong>
          of providing centers that have turned into
          <strong>
           "death traps"
          </strong>
          , saying that the occupation army regularly opens fire on civilians gathered near these centers, causing large numbers of wounded and martyrs.
         </p>
         <p>
          Medical sources confirmed to Al Jazeera that
          <strong>
           50 Palestinians were martyred since dawn on Sunday
          </strong>
          in scattered massacres, including
          <strong>
           22 food seekers
          </strong>
          near aid control centers in Rafah and Nuseirat, where occupation forces have made it a habit to target civilian gatherings around them.

          Hospital Occupancy Rate Doubles
         </h4>
         <p>
          Al-Daqran continued that the occupation's policy has caused a
          <strong>
           complete collapse of the health system
          </strong>
          , as bed occupancy rates in hospitals exceeded
          <strong>
           300%
          </strong>
          , forcing medical staff to spread mattresses in corridors and courtyards to accommodate the influx of injured.
         </p>
         <p>
          According to the spokesperson, hospitals are
          <strong>
           no longer able to receive more cases
          </strong>
          , due to the enormous number of patients, especially from the categories of
          <strong>
           children and elderly
          </strong>
          , who are the two groups most affected by malnutrition and the spread of chronic and infectious diseases.
         </p>
         <p>
          He noted that children's departments in Gaza hospitals are witnessing
          <strong>
           unprecedented overcrowding
          </strong>
          , where doctors are forced to hospitalize
          <strong>
           3 to 4 children on a single bed
          </strong>
          , amid a deteriorating health environment and widespread presence of rats and insects in displacement areas and camps.

        Since the
        <strong>
         "Gaza Humanitarian"
        </strong>
        institution took control of aid flow in May,
        <strong>
         more than 1,500 Palestinians were martyred
        </strong>
        and
        <strong>
         more than 10,000 others were injured
        </strong>
        by fire from the occupation army and foreign contractors with the institution, according to the United Nations and the Ministry of Health in the stricken sector.
       </p>
       <p class="conclusion-paragraph curved-box">
        This escalation comes two days after the visit of American envoy
        <strong>
         Steve Witkoff
        </strong>
        to one of the aid centers in Rafah, at a time when observers see that such visits have become
        <strong>
         political cover for the continued killing of citizens
        </strong>
        under false humanitarian pretense.
